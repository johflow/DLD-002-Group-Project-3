# DLD-002-Group-Project-3
Using the attached instructions, build and upload your LogiSim .circ file here. You should upload a single proj3.circ file as your submission. Note this is a group assignment. That means that only one member of your group need submit for your entire group to receive credit. That also means you should ensure whoever uploads the assignment does so correctly. You are responsible for what is uploaded.
